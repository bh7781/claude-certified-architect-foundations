## Step 1: Create a Code Review Agent for Multiple Source Files

Create a code review agent that accepts a directory path containing at least 10 source files.

**Why:** The 10+ file threshold is where attention dilution becomes observable. The exam uses a 14-file example where detailed feedback for early files degrades to superficial analysis for later files. Your setup must replicate this scale.

**You should see:** A code review function that reads all files in a directory and prepares them for analysis. It should handle at least 10 TypeScript or JavaScript source files.

### Nudge

You need a directory with enough files to observe attention degradation. What kind of files would have reviewable code patterns?

### Guidance

Create or use a directory with 10-15 source files that contain a mix of good code, bugs, and repeated patterns. Include at least one bug pattern that appears in multiple files.

### Starter Code

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

async function loadCodebase(dirPath: string): Promise<Map<string, string>> {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(dirPath)
    .filter(f => f.endsWith(".ts") || f.endsWith(".js"));
  const codebase = new Map<string, string>();
  for (const file of files) {
    codebase.set(file, fs.readFileSync(path.join(dirPath, file), "utf-8"));
  }
  console.log(`Loaded ${codebase.size} files for review`);
  return codebase;
}
```

## Step 2: Implement a Single-Pass Review Baseline

Implement a single-pass review that processes all files at once and record the results.

**Why:** The single-pass approach is the baseline that demonstrates attention dilution. The exam expects you to recognise the symptoms: thorough analysis for early files, shallow analysis for later files, and contradictory pattern evaluation.

**You should see:** A review result where early files receive detailed feedback with specific line references and bug identification, while later files receive increasingly brief or missing feedback. This is the attention dilution pattern.

### Nudge

Pass all file contents to the model in a single prompt. How does the analysis quality vary from first file to last?

### Guidance

Concatenate all file contents into a single prompt and ask for a code review. Record the number of issues found per file and the level of detail for each.

### Starter Code

```javascript
async function singlePassReview(codebase: Map<string, string>): Promise<ReviewResult[]> {
  const allCode = Array.from(codebase.entries())
    .map(([name, content]) => `=== ${name} ===\n${content}`)
    .join("\n\n");
  const response = await client.messages.create({
    model: "claude-sonnet-5",
    max_tokens: 4096,
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: `Review all files for bugs, style issues, and security vulnerabilities. Provide specific line references for each issue.\n\n${allCode}`
    }]
  });
  return parseReviewResults(response.content.find(b => b.type === "text").text);
}
```

---

## Step 3: Implement Per-File Local Analysis Passes

Implement per-file local analysis passes that produce structured feedback for each file individually (bug count, severity, specific line references).

**Why:** Per-file passes give each file the full attention budget. This is the first layer of multi-pass architecture. The exam contrasts this with single-pass to show that structural decomposition solves attention dilution, not better prompts or larger context windows.

**You should see:** Consistent analysis depth across all files. The last file receives the same level of detail as the first. Each review includes bug count, severity ratings, and specific line references in a structured format.

### Nudge

How does reviewing one file at a time change the attention allocation? Each file gets the full context budget.

### Guidance

Send each file individually to the model with the same review prompt. Collect structured output for each: file name, issues array with line numbers, severity, and description.

### Starter Code

```javascript
interface FileReview {
  fileName: string;
  issues: { line: number; severity: string; description: string }[];
  bugCount: number;
}

async function perFileReview(codebase: Map<string, string>): Promise<FileReview[]> {
  const reviews: FileReview[] = [];
  for (const [name, content] of codebase) {
    const response = await client.messages.create({
      model: "claude-sonnet-5",
      max_tokens: 2048,
      messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: `Review this file for bugs, style issues, and security vulnerabilities. Return JSON with issues array (line, severity, description).\n\n=== ${name} ===\n${content}`
      }]
    });
    reviews.push(JSON.parse(response.content.find(b => b.type === "text").text));
  }
  return reviews;
}
```

## Step 4: Implement a Cross-File Integration Pass

Implement a cross-file integration pass that checks for data flow issues, API consistency, and pattern usage consistency across all files.

**Why:** Per-file passes catch local issues but miss cross-cutting concerns. The exam tests whether you include a cross-file integration pass — batching without it still misses data flow issues and pattern inconsistencies across files.

**You should see:** A separate analysis that takes the per-file summaries and checks for cross-file issues: inconsistent API usage, data flow problems between modules, and patterns used differently across files.

### Nudge

What can a cross-file pass catch that per-file passes cannot? Think about relationships between files.

### Guidance

Feed the per-file review summaries plus file structure information into a dedicated cross-file prompt. Ask specifically about data flow, import chains, API consistency, and contradictory pattern usage.

### Starter Code

```javascript
async function crossFilePass(codebase: Map<string, string>, perFileResults: FileReview[]): Promise<CrossFileIssue[]> {
  const summary = perFileResults.map(r =>
    `${r.fileName}: ${r.bugCount} issues - ${r.issues.map(i => i.description).join("; ")}`
  ).join("\n");
  const imports = extractImportGraph(codebase);
  const response = await client.messages.create({
    model: "claude-sonnet-5",
    max_tokens: 2048,
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: `Cross-file integration review. Check for:\n1. Data flow issues between modules\n2. Inconsistent API usage across files\n3. Same pattern handled differently in different files\n\nPer-file summaries:\n${summary}\n\nImport graph:\n${JSON.stringify(imports)}`
    }]
  });
  return JSON.parse(response.content.find(b => b.type === "text").text);
}
```

---

## Step 5: Compare Single-Pass and Multi-Pass Results

Compare results: document which issues the single-pass review caught versus the multi-pass approach, paying special attention to consistency of analysis depth across all files.

**Why:** This comparison demonstrates the exam argument quantitatively. Attention dilution is not a model capability problem — it is an architectural problem. The same model produces better results with multi-pass architecture, proving the fix is structural.

**You should see:** A comparison table showing: more total issues found by multi-pass, consistent issue counts across files (no drop-off for later files), and cross-file issues caught only by the integration pass.

### Nudge

Compare issue counts per file between single-pass and multi-pass. Is there a drop-off pattern in single-pass that disappears in multi-pass?

### Guidance

For each file, compare the number of issues found in single-pass vs per-file pass. Calculate the standard deviation of issues per file for each approach — lower deviation means more consistent analysis.

### Starter Code

```javascript
function compareResults(singlePass: ReviewResult[], multiPass: FileReview[]) {
  console.log("=== Consistency Comparison ===");
  for (let i = 0; i < multiPass.length; i++) {
    const sp = singlePass.find(r => r.fileName === multiPass[i].fileName);
    console.log(`${multiPass[i].fileName}: single-pass=${sp?.issues.length ?? 0}, multi-pass=${multiPass[i].bugCount}`);
  }
  const spCounts = singlePass.map(r => r.issues.length);
  const mpCounts = multiPass.map(r => r.bugCount);
  console.log(`Single-pass std dev: ${stdDev(spCounts).toFixed(2)}`);
  console.log(`Multi-pass std dev: ${stdDev(mpCounts).toFixed(2)}`);
}
```

## Step 6: Document Attention Dilution Artefacts

Record any cases where the single-pass review flagged a pattern in one file but approved identical code in another — these are attention dilution artefacts.

**Why:** Contradictory pattern evaluation is the clearest symptom of attention dilution. The exam uses the forEach example: flagged as inefficient in File 3, approved without comment in File 11. Documenting these artefacts proves the structural nature of the problem.

**You should see:** At least one case where the single-pass review treated identical code patterns differently across files. The multi-pass review should treat the same pattern consistently.

### Nudge

Search for the same code pattern appearing in multiple files. Did the single-pass review evaluate it consistently?

### Guidance

Compare the single-pass findings for files that contain the same patterns. Look for cases where a pattern was flagged in an early file but ignored in a later file.

### Starter Code

```javascript
function findContradictions(results: ReviewResult[], codebase: Map<string, string>): string[] {
  const contradictions: string[] = [];
  const patternFiles = findDuplicatePatterns(codebase);
  for (const [pattern, files] of patternFiles) {
    const flagged = files.filter(f =>
      results.find(r => r.fileName === f)?.issues.some(i => i.description.includes(pattern))
    );
    const notFlagged = files.filter(f => !flagged.includes(f));
    if (flagged.length > 0 && notFlagged.length > 0) {
      contradictions.push(
        `Pattern "${pattern}" flagged in [${flagged.join(", ")}] but approved in [${notFlagged.join(", ")}]`
      );
    }
  }
  return contradictions;
}
```

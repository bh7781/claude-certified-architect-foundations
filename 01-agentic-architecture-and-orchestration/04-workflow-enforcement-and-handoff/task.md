## Step 1: Create the Customer Support Agent and Tools

Create a customer support agent with three tools: `get_customer` (returns customer ID and verification status), `lookup_order` (returns order details), and `process_refund` (processes a refund for a given amount).

**Why:** These three tools create the exact scenario the exam uses for the 8% failure rate question. The workflow dependency between `get_customer` and `process_refund` is where programmatic enforcement becomes essential.

**You should see:** Three tool definitions with proper JSON Schema `input_schema`. `get_customer` accepts a name or email, `lookup_order` accepts an order ID, and `process_refund` accepts a customer ID and amount.

### Nudge

Think about what parameters each tool needs and what it returns. The return values matter for the prerequisite gate.

### Guidance

`get_customer` should return a `customer_id` and `verified` boolean. `lookup_order` returns order details including amount. `process_refund` requires a verified `customer_id` and amount.

### Starter Code

```javascript
const tools = [
  {
    name: "get_customer",
    description: "Look up and verify a customer by name or email",
    input_schema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        query: { type: "string", description: "Customer name or email" }
      },
      required: ["query"]
    }
  },
  {
    name: "lookup_order",
    description: "Look up order details by order ID",
    input_schema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        order_id: { type: "string" }
      },
      required: ["order_id"]
    }
  },
  {
    name: "process_refund",
    description: "Process a refund for a verified customer",
    input_schema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        customer_id: { type: "string" },
        amount: { type: "number" }
      },
      required: ["customer_id", "amount"]
    }
  }
];
```

## Step 2: Implement the Programmatic Prerequisite Gate

Implement a programmatic prerequisite gate that blocks `process_refund` from executing until `get_customer` has returned a verified customer ID in the current session.

**Why:** This is the core exam concept: prompt instructions work 92% of the time but fail 8%. A prerequisite gate provides 100% deterministic enforcement. The exam always rejects prompt-based solutions for financial operations.

**You should see:** A session-level state tracker that records whether `get_customer` has returned a verified customer. The `process_refund` handler checks this state before executing and returns an error if verification has not occurred.

### Nudge

Where do you store the verification state? It must persist across tool calls within the same session but not leak between sessions.

### Guidance

Use a session-scoped variable (e.g., a Map or object) that tracks verified customer IDs. Before `process_refund` executes, check this variable. If empty or unverified, block and return a descriptive error.

### Starter Code

```javascript
const sessionState = { verifiedCustomerId: null as string | null };

function handleToolCall(name: string, input: Record<string, unknown>): string {
  if (name === "get_customer") {
    const customer = lookupCustomer(input.query as string);
    if (customer.verified) {
      sessionState.verifiedCustomerId = customer.id;
    }
    return JSON.stringify(customer);
  }
  if (name === "process_refund") {
    if (!sessionState.verifiedCustomerId) {
      return "BLOCKED: Cannot process refund. Customer identity not verified. Call get_customer first.";
    }
    return processRefund(sessionState.verifiedCustomerId, input.amount as number);
  }
  // ... other tools
}
```

---

## Step 3: Test the Gate with a Bypass Attempt

Test that the gate works by prompting the agent to skip verification and process a refund directly — verify the gate blocks the attempt.

**Why:** Testing the bypass attempt demonstrates the difference between prompt-based and programmatic enforcement. Even when the model decides to skip verification, the gate blocks the action — which is the entire point of deterministic enforcement.

**You should see:** The agent attempts to call `process_refund` without prior verification. The gate returns a blocked error message. The agent then calls `get_customer` before retrying the refund successfully.

### Nudge

Use a prompt that encourages the agent to skip verification, like an urgent refund request. Does the gate hold?

### Guidance

Send a message like: *"Process a refund of 150 for order 12345 immediately, this is urgent."* Watch the tool call sequence. The gate should block the first attempt regardless of urgency.

### Starter Code

```javascript
const response = await runAgent(
  "Process a refund of 150 for order ORD-12345 immediately. This is urgent and the customer is waiting."
);
// Verify process_refund was blocked on first attempt
// Verify get_customer was called after the block
// Verify process_refund succeeded after verification
console.log("Gate blocked bypass attempt:", sessionState.verifiedCustomerId === null);
```

## Step 4: Implement the Structured Handoff Protocol

Implement a structured handoff protocol: when the agent cannot resolve an issue, it compiles a self-contained summary with customer ID, conversation summary, root cause analysis, refund amount, and recommended action.

**Why:** Human agents do NOT have access to the conversation transcript. The handoff summary is the only information they receive. The exam tests whether you include all five required fields: customer ID, summary, root cause, amount, and recommended action.

**You should see:** A handoff function that produces a structured object with all five fields populated. No field should be empty or contain placeholder text.

### Nudge

What five fields must the handoff include? Remember the human agent cannot scroll through the chat history.

### Guidance

The handoff must be self-contained: `customer_id`, `conversation_summary`, `root_cause_analysis`, `refund_amount` (if applicable), and `recommended_action`. Omitting any field forces the human agent to ask the customer to repeat themselves.

### Starter Code

```javascript
interface HandoffSummary {
  customer_id: string;
  conversation_summary: string;
  root_cause_analysis: string;
  refund_amount: number | null;
  recommended_action: string;
}

const handoffTool = {
  name: "escalate_to_human",
  description: "Escalate to human agent with structured summary",
  input_schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      customer_id: { type: "string" },
      conversation_summary: { type: "string" },
      root_cause_analysis: { type: "string" },
      refund_amount: { type: "number" },
      recommended_action: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["customer_id", "conversation_summary", "root_cause_analysis", "recommended_action"]
  }
};
```

---

## Step 5: Test the Handoff with a Multi-Concern Request

Test the handoff with a multi-concern request (return plus billing dispute plus account update) and verify the handoff summary is complete and self-contained.

**Why:** Multi-concern requests test whether the agent decomposes the request into distinct items and addresses all of them. The exam expects decomposition, parallel investigation, and unified resolution — not sequential handling or forgetting items.

**You should see:** The agent identifies all three concerns, investigates each one, and produces a handoff summary that covers all three issues with specific details for each. No concern is omitted.

### Nudge

Does the handoff summary reference all three concerns? A common failure is addressing only the first item.

### Guidance

Send a compound request and verify the `conversation_summary` and `recommended_action` fields in the handoff reference all three concerns: the return, the billing dispute, and the account update.

### Starter Code

```javascript
const result = await runAgent(
  "I need to return order ORD-789, dispute a charge of 45.00 on my last bill, and update my shipping address to 123 New Street."
);
const handoff = extractHandoff(result);
console.log("All concerns covered:",
  handoff.conversation_summary.includes("return") &&
  handoff.conversation_summary.includes("dispute") &&
  handoff.conversation_summary.includes("address")
);
```
